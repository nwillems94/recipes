Combine the rye, Campari and simple syrup in a mixing glass filled with ice. Stir until well-chilled and strain into an old fashioned glass with a large cube. Express the lemon peel over the cocktail, then drop in the drink. This is a drink that rewards slow sippers. The complexity of the Campari shines over time as the bitterness is tamed by slight dilution.
