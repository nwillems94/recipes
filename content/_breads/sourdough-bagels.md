Add sourdough starter (discard), water, flour, and sugar to a bowl and bring together to form a shaggy dough. Let rest for around 15 minutes.

Knead the dough for around 10 minutes until it is smooth and supple. This is a stiff dough so it won't be super elastic, however it should be smooth and not sticky. Let rise around 3-4 hours.

Add salt and knead the dough again for around 5 minutes until the salt is fully incorporated. Refrigerate overnight (6-10 hours).

Divide the dough into equal pieces weighing 80g each. Shape each piece of dough into a small ball. Take each ball and poke a hole in the middle. Gently stretch the hole out and then place each bagel on a sheet of baking paper, cover with a dish cloth, and let rise for 1-2 hours.

Preheat oven to 400°F and bring a large pot with water and molasses to a boil.

Carefully boil 3-4 bagels at a time for around 30 seconds each. They should float to the surface when ready. Boil longer for chewier bagels (up to 2 minutes). Remove using a slotted spoon, dip the wet bagel in seasoning, and place on baking tray. 

Bake for 20-25 minutes. Remove them from the oven when they are golden brown and let cool before slicing.
