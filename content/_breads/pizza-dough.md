Combine flour and yeast in a large bowl.

Create a water-salt mixture and slowly combine.

Stir to eliminate dry spots then knead for ~3 minutes.

Cover the dough and let rest at room temp for 24 hours. Place in the fridge for 1-3 days.

4-5 hours before baking, make dough balls by folding the dough in half, rotating 90° and folding in half again. The resulting seam should always be on the same side (in order to make a ball). Repeat ~15 times until a taught ball is formed. Leave covered at room temperature.

Preheat oven to 500°F at least 45 minutes before baking. Bake for 5 minutes, rotate 180° and bake an additional 5 minutes.
