Mix flour and water by hand until no dry spots remain. Let sit for 20 minutes.

Add salt and yeast. Mix by hand by stretching, folding, and pinching. Repeat until the ingredients are well mixed.

Fold the dough 4 times - twice at 15 minute intervals, then twice at 30 minute intervals. Let the dough rise for a total of 5 hours from mixing.

On a floured work surface, shape the dough into a tight ball (using a bench scraper and hand). 

Place seam side down into a floured proofing basket. Cover with plastic and place in refrigerator for 12-14 hours. 

In a preheated Dutch oven, bake at 475F for 30 minutes with the lid on, then an additional 25 minutes with the lid off.
