Combine ingredients in a large bowl and knead to form a smooth dough (~5 min).

Allow the dough to rise, covered, until it's doubled in size (~90 minutes).

Divide the dough in half. Pre-shape into balls by pulling edges into the center, turning over so the seam is on the bottom, and rolling under cupped hand. Let the dough rest, covered, for 15 minutes.

Place the loaves on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover and let rise until very puffy, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 425°F.

Score the loaves with a lame. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until it's a very deep golden brown. Remove it from the oven, and cool on a rack.
