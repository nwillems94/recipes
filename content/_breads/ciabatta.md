In a large bowl, stir to combine flour and salt then add water, oil, and sourdough starter. Bring together into a shaggy dough. Let rest for at least 30 minutes.

Stretch and fold the dough. Repeat 2 more times at 30-minute intervals. Cover and let rest overnight at room temperature (6-10 hours).

Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and divide into equal pieces. Gently stretch into rectangles, handling minimally to retain air bubbles. 

Bake on a steel preheated to 500°F for 15-20 minutes until golden brown.
