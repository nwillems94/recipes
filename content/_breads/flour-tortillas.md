In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the butter, then pour over the hot water. Stir until a shaggy dough begins to form.

Knead the dough for 1-2 minutes until it forms a smooth ball. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and let rest 10 minutes.

Cut into 8 equal pieces, then roll each into a ball. Press the balls into 8 inch circles.

Cook 30-60 seconds, until little bubbles appear on the surface. Press again, then flip and cook another 30 seconds, or until the bottom is slightly golden.
