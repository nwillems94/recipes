Combine water and yeast in a large mixing bowl. Add olive oil, flour, and salt and let hydrate for 20 minutes. Knead for about 10 minutes, the dough should be soft, elastic, and slightly sticky. Place in an oiled bowl for 12 to 24 hours.

Place 2 tbsp of olive oil on a baking sheet. Turn out the dough and let it warm up for ~10 minutes. Stretch into all corners of the backing sheet, giving more time to relax if necessary. Let dough sit for 30-40 minutes for a second rise. 

Top with cheese, dot with sauce, and other toppings.

Bake at for 500F for 20-30 minutes
