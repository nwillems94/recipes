Combine dry ingredients in a bowl. Add water and mix until a shaggy dough forms. Let rest for 20 minutes.

Knead for 2-3 minutes, then cover and let bulk ferment for 12 hours at room temperature, then 12 hours refrigerated.

Remove from fridge and divide into 2 portions.

Stretch into a square and fold like a letter (in thirds), rotate 90° and fold in thirds again. Let dough rest 30 minutes. Repeat 3 times, rotating 90° before each subsequent fold.

For the fourth fold, fold like a letter as before, then, without rotating the dough, fold in half. Tightly pinch the seams closed with each fold. Let rest 30 minutes.

Gently roll the dough to ~14'' in length and pinch the ends closed. Let rest for 1-1.5 hours.

Lame the top of the loaves. Place seam side down in a 500°F oven. Bake covered for 15 minutes, then 5-8 minutes uncovered.
