In a large bowl, dissolve the starter into the water, then add the flour and mix by hand, into a shaggy dough. Cover the bowl and set aside somewhere warm for about 30 minutes.

Sprinkle the salt on top of the dough and work the dough until the salt has been combined. Cover and rest again for 30 minutes.

Stretch and fold the dough. Using a wet hand, go under the dough pull a portion and then stretch it up and over the dough, repeating this four times around the bowl. Cover and rest for 30 minutes, repeating this process 3 more times.

Rest the dough for 1-2 hours until the it has risen around 40-50% and shows signs of fermentation. The dough should have a jiggle and have lots of bubbles on the surface.

Place a sheet of parchment paper in a quarter sheet pan and spread 3 tbsps of extra virgin olive oil. Carefully transfer the dough to the sheet pan and top with a little oil to prevent it drying out.

Cover pan and refrigerate for 18-24 hours.

Remove from the fridge 1-3 hours before baking. Preheat a convection oven to 450°F.

Using a garlic press, spread 3 medium cloves on top. Drizzle the focaccia generously with extra virgin olive oil and dimple the dough all over using oiled fingers. Sprinkle generously with chopped rosemary.

Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes then reduce the temperature to 375°F and bake for a further 15 minutes or until the focaccia is golden brown.

Remove from the oven, sprinkle with flakey sea salt, and carefully transfer the bread to a wire rack to cool.
