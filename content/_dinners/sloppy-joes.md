Place a large skillet over medium-high heat. Crumble ground beef into skillet; add onion and celery. Cook and stir beef mixture until beef is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes.
Stir ketchup, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, mustard, and lemon juice through the beef mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook mixture at a simmer until mixture is hot and sauce has thickened, about 20 minutes.
