Preheat a grill to medium high. Brush the corn and onion rings with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill, turning occasionally, until lightly charred and tender, about 8 minutes for the onion rings and about 10 minutes for the corn. Set aside to cool.
Combine the lime juice and half the cilantro in a blender and pulse until chunky. With the blender running, pour in the olive oil in a slow, steady stream to make a thick dressing. Season with salt and pepper.
Cut the corn off the cobs and roughly chop the onion. Combine in a large bowl with the avocados, tomatoes, beans and pimientos. Roughly chop the remaining cilantro and add to the bowl. Drizzle with the dressing and toss well. Season with salt and pepper, if needed.
