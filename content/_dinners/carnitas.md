Preheat the oven to 350F.

Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven over a burner turned to medium-high. Sear the pork loin on each side, about 4 minutes per side, until a crust has formed.

Turn the burner off and add the stock, onion, garlic, orange juice, lime juice and spices.

Cover and place in the preheated oven for 2-3 hours. When you can pull apart the pork with a fork, it is done.

If a crispy carnitas is desired, spread the pork out on to a sheet pan and turn the oven to high broil.
Broil for 2-3 minutes, until a crust has formed on the meat. Watch carefully so the pork doesn’t burn.
