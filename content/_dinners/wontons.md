Combine pork, shrimp, and egg in a bowl, mixing well by stirring in one direction. Begin slowly adding cold water, about 1 part water to 3 parts meat (by weight), while continuing to stir in the same direction until the mixture is well combined and sticky.

Add sugar, pepper, green onions, and ginger. Continue to stir until the mixture becomes sticky again. 

Remove wonton skins from refrigerator (if from freezer, take out the night before). Use about 1 tsp filling, wrap and use little water on the edge of the skin to seal tightly. Place on a sheet tray to boil immediately or freeze for later.
