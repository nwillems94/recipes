Heat olive oil in a large wide heavy pot over medium-high. Add pork nuggets and cook, undisturbed, until well browned underneath, about 5 minutes. Turn pieces and continue to cook, turning occasionally, until pork is browned on 2–3 sides, about 5 minutes longer.

Add ginger and garlic (and remaining meat) until meat is nearly cooked through, about 5 minutes longer.

Break up meat and add tomato paste and basil sprig. Cook, stirring occasionally, until paste darkens, about 2 minutes.

Add chili paste, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar and water mixture. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until sauce is slightly thickened and flavors have melded, 30–45 minutes.

Add noodles along with some butter & cooking liquid
