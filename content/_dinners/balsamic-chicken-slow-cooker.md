In a large slow cooker, add Brussels sprouts and potatoes in an even layer and place chicken on top.
In a small bowl, whisk together balsamic vinegar, chicken broth, brown sugar, mustard, dried thyme, rosemary, oregano, and crushed red pepper flakes. Season generously with salt and pepper.
Pour marinade over chicken and vegetables. Scatter all over with garlic.
Cover and cook on high until chicken is fall-apart tender, 4 1/2 to 5 hours.
Garnish with parsley and serve with the juices.
