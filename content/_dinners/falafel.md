Pour the chickpeas into a large bowl and cover them by about 3 inches of cold water. Let them soak overnight. They will double in size as they soak

Drain and rinse the garbanzo beans well. Pour them into your food processor along with the chopped onion, garlic cloves, parsley, flour, salt, cumin, ground coriander, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and cardamom 

Pulse all ingredients together until a rough, coarse meal forms. Process till the mixture is somewhere between the texture of couscous and a paste. 

Once the mixture reaches the desired consistency, pour it out into a bowl and use a fork to stir; this will make the texture more even throughout. Remove any large chickpea chunks that the processor missed.

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1-2 hours.

Fill a skillet with vegetable oil to a depth of 1.5 inches. Heat the oil slowly over medium heat. The ideal temperature to fry falafel is between 360° and 375°F

Meanwhile, form falafel mixture into round balls or slider-shaped patties using wet hands or a falafel scoop. About 2 tbsp of mixture per falafel. If the oil is at the right temperature, it will take 2-3 minutes per side to brown (5-6 minutes total)

Reprocess if they won't hold together
