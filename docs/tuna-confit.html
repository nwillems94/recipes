<p>Cut the tuna into walnut-sized chunks and season with salt. Cover and refrigerate for 2-3 hours</p>

<p>Pat the tuna dry and crowd chunks into a small saucepan (a snugger fit minimizes oil consumption). Distribute zest, bay leaves, chili flakes, black pepper, garlic, &amp; fennel. Add olive oil to barely cover.</p>

<p>Put over lowest possible heat and bring to a hesitant simmer. Cook uncovered for about 30 minutes - stirring a few times and taking a care to not let the oil boil.</p>
