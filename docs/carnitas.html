<p>Preheat the oven to 350F.</p>

<p>Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven over a burner turned to medium-high. Sear the pork loin on each side, about 4 minutes per side, until a crust has formed.</p>

<p>Turn the burner off and add the stock, onion, garlic, orange juice, lime juice and spices.</p>

<p>Cover and place in the preheated oven for 2-3 hours. When you can pull apart the pork with a fork, it is done.</p>

<p>If a crispy carnitas is desired, spread the pork out on to a sheet pan and turn the oven to high broil.
Broil for 2-3 minutes, until a crust has formed on the meat. Watch carefully so the pork doesn’t burn.</p>
