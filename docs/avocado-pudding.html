<p>Scoop the avocado flesh into your blender container and then add the almond milk, cocoa powder, honey, vanilla, and cinnamon.</p>

<p>Puree on high speed for one minute, or until a creamy consistency. Stop to scrape down the sides, as needed.</p>

<p>Taste and add additional honey if needed. The goal is subtle sweetness to balance the richness of the cocoa and avocado.</p>

<p>Spoon (or pipe) the pudding into tea cups or small ramekins.</p>

<p>Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to an hour. Prior to serving, sprinkle a little flaky sea salt on top.</p>
