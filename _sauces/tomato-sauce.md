Place tomatoes in a medium saucepan over medium low heat, add onion, and stir in butter and salt. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally and mashing any large pieces of tomato using the back of a wooden spoon, until fat floats free from the tomatoes and is incorporated into the sauce as it slightly thickens, 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes.

Season with additional salt to taste.

Remove and discard onion.

Finished sauce can be frozen in an airtight, freezer-safe container for up to 1 month. Be sure to remove and discard the onion before freezing.
