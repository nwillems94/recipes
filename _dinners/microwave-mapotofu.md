Add the mushrooms, Sichuan peppercorns, oil, ginger, garlic, fermented black beans, and chili paste to the deep Anyday dish. Stir to mix. Cover with the lid (knob lifted). Microwave for 2 minutes, or until fragrant.

Add stock and stir to mix. Carefully place the tofu in the sauce. Cover and cook for 5 minutes, or until the mapo tofu is hot.

In a separate small bowl, stir cornstarch with soy sauce to create a slurry. Add to the Anyday dish. Cover and cook for 2 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.

Garnish with a drizzle of sesame oil and a sprinkle of scallions, if using.
