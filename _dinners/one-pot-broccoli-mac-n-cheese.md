In a large pot, combine the macaroni, broccoli, milk, salt and garlic powder. Add 3 cups of water, and stir to combine.

Bring to an active simmer over medium-high. Reduce the heat to medium to gently simmer. Cook, stirring often to ensure even cooking and to keep things from sticking to the bottom of the pot, until the pasta is tender, and the liquid resembles heavy cream and coats the noodles, 8 to 12 minutes. If the liquid evaporates so much that you don’t see any between noodles, add ½ cup water.

Remove from heat and stir in the Cheddar and butter. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Eat!
