In a large pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add jalapeños and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. 

Add tomato paste, stir to coat vegetables, and cook about a minute more. Season with salt, pepper, cumin, and chili powder and stir to coat.

Add black beans and broth. Stir soup, add bay leaf, and bring to a boil. Immediately reduce to a simmer and let simmer until slightly reduced and thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. (If a thinner soup is desired, add more broth as needed.)

Remove bay leaf and let cool slightly. Using an immersion blender or food processor, blend soup to desired consistency.

Serve with a dollop of sour cream, sliced avocado, and cilantro.
