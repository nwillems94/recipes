Add 3 tbsp of olive oil to a medium pot or Dutch oven. Heat over medium heat until shimmering, then add half of the mushrooms, half of the pearl onions, ½ tsp salt, ¼ tsp pepper. Stir to combine, then cover and cook until the mushrooms have released all of their liquid, 6-8 minutes. 

Uncover and increase the temperature to medium-high. Continue cooking the vegetables until all of the moisture has evaporated, 8-10 minutes. 

Transfer the cooked vegetables to large bowl and reserve. Repeat with another 3 tbsps of oil and the remaining mushrooms, pearl onions, salt, and pepper. 

Add 2 tbsp of oil to the pot and heat over medium-high heat. Whisk in the flour until a dry paste forms. Cook the roux for 1-2 minutes or until it turns golden brown. 

Add broth very slowly, whisking constantly. The mixture should thicken as the roux is incorporated into the liquid. Once all of the broth is incorporated, stir in tomato paste, miso paste, yellow onions, carrots, garlic, porcini mushrooms, parsley sprigs, thyme sprigs, bay leaves, peppercorns, and 2 cups of wine. Bring the mixture to boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 12 - 15 minutes.

Strain the mixture and reserve the cooking liquid. Then, return the liquid back to the pot and stir in the remaining wine. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Cook for 6-8 minutes, stirring periodically, until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. 

Reduce heat to a simmer, then add the reserved mushroom/onion mixture, and cook until just heated through, 2 to 4 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
