Cook the chicken
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the chicken in 1 tablespoon of butter until a thermometer inserted into the largest part reads 165°F, four to five minutes on each side. Remove the chicken from the pan and keep it warm. Editor's Tip: Melt the butter in a bit of olive oil to keep it from burning while the chicken cooks.
Make the rosemary sauce
Add the wine to the same pan and cook it over medium-low heat, stirring to loosen the browned bits from the pan. Add the cream and bring the pan to a boil. Reduce the heat, and cook and stir until the cream is slightly thickened. Add the rosemary and the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter. Stir the sauce until it's blended. Serve the sauce with the chicken. Editor's Tip: You can also add the chicken back to the pan along with the rosemary and butter so that it can absorb some of that yummy sauce while it further thickens and everything blends.
