1. Preheat the broiler to high. Arrange the poblanos, serrano peppers, and garlic on a baking sheet. Broil 2 minutes, until charred. Flip and broil 2-4 more minutes. Watch the garlic closely.

2. To make the salsa. If desired, de-seed the serrano pepper, then slice, add to a small bowl. Finely chop or mash the garlic and add to the bowl with the peppers. Add the cilantro, green onion, 2 tbsps olive oil, lime juice, and a pinch of salt.

3. Peel charred skin, de-seed, and thinly slice poblanos.

4. To assemble, layer cheese, rice, avocado, and poblanos on one half of a tortilla. Drizzle over the salsa verde, then sprinkle over more cheese. Fold the tortilla over to cover everything.

5. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a skillet, add 1 quesadilla, and cook 2-3 minutes per side until crisp and golden brown. Serve warm with cilantro, chile salsa, and a dollop of Greek yogurt
