Add oil to a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onions and chicken, and let cook untouched for 2-3 minutes. Continue to cook for another 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper.

Stir in the rice until completely coated with the oil.

Add lemon juice and let boil until completely evaporated, about 1 minute.

Stir in the chicken broth, cover, and stick the whole pot into a 400° oven. Cook until most of the liquid has been absorbed, about 25 minutes.

Remove from oven, and stir in the butter, Parmesan cheese, lemon zest, arugula and ½ cup water.
