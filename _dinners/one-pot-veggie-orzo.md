Heat olive oil in a large (12-inch) skillet, for which you have a lid, set over medium. And the onions, lightly season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 8 minutes. Turn the heat to medium-low, add the zucchini and garlic, and cook for 2 more minutes, stirring often.

Add the tomatoes, basil, red-pepper flakes, 1 tsp salt and black pepper to taste. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes have completely collapsed, 12 to 15 minutes. Add the balsamic vinegar and tomato paste and cook for 2 more minutes, stirring occasionally.

Add 2½ cups water and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add the orzo, corn, and ½ tsp salt, mix well, and turn the heat to low. Cover and simmer for 10 to 12 minutes, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan 3 or 4 times, until the pasta is cooked. The pasta should look “saucy” as it cooks; if at any point it looks dry, add another ¼ cup water.

Off the heat, add the mozzarella and Parmesan and stir gently until just combined. Top with fresh basil and more red-pepper flakes if desired, and serve hot.
