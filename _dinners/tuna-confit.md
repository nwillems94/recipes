Cut the tuna into walnut-sized chunks and season with salt. Cover and refrigerate for 2-3 hours

Pat the tuna dry and crowd chunks into a small saucepan (a snugger fit minimizes oil consumption). Distribute zest, bay leaves, chili flakes, black pepper, garlic, & fennel. Add olive oil to barely cover. 

Put over lowest possible heat and bring to a hesitant simmer. Cook uncovered for about 30 minutes - stirring a few times and taking a care to not let the oil boil.
