Serves 4

1. Preheat oven to 250F.

2. Add the garlic, tomatoes, oil, thyme, salt and red pepper flakes (optional) into a medium baking pan. Bake for about 90 minutes.

3. Then remove from oven and turn off oven. Gently smash the garlic and tomatoes with a fork or potato masher. (Be careful when smashing as the hot juice from the tomatoes may splatter on you.) Place back in the oven while the pasta is cooking to keep the confit warm. 4. Cook pasta al dente according to package

5. Mixed the drained pasta with the confit (including the olive oil) in a bowl. Add the grated cheeses and parsley. Season with salt and black pepper
