Gather the ingredients.
Cook the pasta in the water with 1 teaspoon of salt.
Turn off the heat and drain almost all the water, reserving about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of the cooking water, then add the beans.
Cover and set aside.
In a separate skillet, add the olive oil and saute the diced onions , minced garlic, fresh chopped basil, oregano and remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt and pepper for 3 to 5 minutes, until the onions are soft.
Add the onions and spices to the beans and pasta pot and place over low heat.
As the mixture is heating over low heat, add the paprika and tomato sauce and stir until well blended and heated through. (You can add a little bit more liquid, if you prefer a "soupier" dish, or heat it a little bit longer to cook off some more moisture if you find it too liquidy.)
Serve your vegetarian pasta fagioli hot and top it off with some Parmesan cheese or nutritional yeast to keep it vegan.
Enjoy your Italian dinner!
