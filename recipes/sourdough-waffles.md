The night before cooking the pancakes, combine the starter with the milk and flour in a bowl.

Loosely cover the bowl of starter-flour mixture and set in a warm place (70-75°F) for at least 8 hours or overnight. The mixture will be bubbly and somewhat expanded in size, though not doubled in volume.

In the morning, add the eggs, sugar, baking soda, salt, and butter to the bowl and stir well. The batter will be thick and somewhat elastic. Let the batter rest for about 10 minutes.
