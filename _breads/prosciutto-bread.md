Whisk together flour, sugar, pepper and yeast; then add salt

Add water and stir until moistened.

Knead on countertop for 10 minutes until the dough is very elastic.

Knead in the prosciutto until the dough is just a little tacky, adding flour as needed

Dust with flour, let relax under plastic wrap for 20 minutes

Roll the dough into an 18'' rope, overlap the end by 2'' to form a ring. Let rise on Silpain for 1 hour or until doubled in size.
