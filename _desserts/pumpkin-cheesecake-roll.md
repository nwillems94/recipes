In a large bowl, beat eggs and sugar. Beat in remaining cake ingredients.
Grease a 10"x15" jelly roll pan. Line pan with waxed paper, then grease and lightly flour the waxed paper.
Pour batter into the pan and spread evenly. Bake at 350F for 15 minutes. *Cake cooks fast so watch carefully to avoid burning the edges.
While cake is baking, sprinkle powdered sugar heavily over the kitchen towel, using a sieve or sifter.
Turn hot cake onto the towel.
Remove waxed paper. Trim off burnt or crusty edges.
Sprinkle more powdered sugar over the hot cake and quickly roll up with towel inside. Let cake cool completely, about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare filling by beating together all ingredients until smooth and creamy.
Unroll cooled cake and spread with the filling mixture. Roll up cake with filling on the inside. Wrap in waxed paper and then foil.
Refrigerate or freeze. To serve, slice cake about 1/3 inch thick and sprinkle with powdered sugar.
Note - cake cuts best when still slightly frozen.
