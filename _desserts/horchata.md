Soak the rice overnight or at least 8 hours in water with cinnamon sticks.

The next day discard cinnamon sticks and blend the rice and water in your blender at the highest speed for about 5 minutes.

Pass through a fine mesh sieve about two times to catch all the gritty bits. (A stocking works great) Discard the remaining rice pulp.

Pour into a pitcher, add skim milk, sugar, cinnamon and vanilla and mix well by stirring. Refrigerate until ready to serve.

To serve fill a glass with ice, pour horchata into a glass and sprinkle a little cinnamon on each serving just before drinking.
