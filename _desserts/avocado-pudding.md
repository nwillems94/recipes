Scoop the avocado flesh into your blender container and then add the almond milk, cocoa powder, honey, vanilla, and cinnamon. 

Puree on high speed for one minute, or until a creamy consistency. Stop to scrape down the sides, as needed. 

Taste and add additional honey if needed. The goal is subtle sweetness to balance the richness of the cocoa and avocado. 

Spoon (or pipe) the pudding into tea cups or small ramekins. 

Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to an hour. Prior to serving, sprinkle a little flaky sea salt on top.
