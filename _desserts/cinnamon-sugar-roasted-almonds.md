Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Lightly grease a 10x15-inch jellyroll pan.
Lightly beat egg white in a large bowl. Add water; beat until frothy but not stiff.
Stir in nuts until well coated.
Mix sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a small bowl. Sprinkle sugar mixture over nuts; toss to coat. Spread evenly onto the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 1 hour. Allow to cool, then store nuts in an airtight container.
