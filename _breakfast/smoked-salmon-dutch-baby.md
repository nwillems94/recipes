For 2:

Preheat the oven to 430°F. Place a heatproof pan or baking dish in the oven.

Whisk together flour, eggs, and half the milk until smooth. Add remaining milk and stir until smooth again. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.

Add 1 tbsp butter to the hot pan or oven dish. Immediately put back in the oven and let it melt.

Once the butter has melted, pour in the batter. Bake in the oven for about 18 minutes, until the pancake has risen considerably.

Reduce the oven to 300°F degrees and bake for another 5 minutes.

Spread the crème fraîche, arugula, red onion, and smoked salmon over the pancake.

Garnish with lemon juice.
